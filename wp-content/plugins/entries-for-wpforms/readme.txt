Entries For WPForms Lite Plugin. Store your WPForms submission entries to your database and view from within your WordPress dashboard.

== Description ==

### STORE AND DISPLAY THE ENTRIES OF WPFORMS LITE PLUGIN

All your WPForms entries are stored in your WordPress database and are easily accessible from inside your WordPress dashboard. If you have multiple forms, you can easily sort through entries by each form. Also, send emails with entries details to users/admin at any time on a single button click, will be helpful if in any case user/admin couldnot receive emails during form submission. You can display the entries on frontend as well with shortcode [wpforms_entries id="x"].

Note that since v1.4.7, new separate menu is created instead of WPForms submenu.

= Can I translate Entries For WPForms?

Yes. The plugin is translation ready. You can use any tranlstion plugin. Or customize the plugins language with the provided pot file. The recommended way is to help Entries For WPForms by contributing the translation on [WordPress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/entries-for-wpforms).

Yes. You can disable storing users ip addresses and geolocation data. Also, export and erase the users submission upon their request. However, consult your lawyer to be 100% certain.

= What's Next?

Nothing much. I expect WPForms team to include the entries panel in lite version, so that users may not need to use this plugin anymore.
